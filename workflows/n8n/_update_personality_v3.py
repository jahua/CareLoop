"""
Final refinement of personality detection in N8N workflows.
Fixes identified from scatter plot analysis:
1. N compressed to [-0.4, +0.1] — model never assigns positive N
2. E compressed for high values — det_E averages 0.3 when gt_E > 0.6
3. O capped at +0.3 — underestimates varied-vocabulary speakers

Changes:
- Add RANGE CALIBRATION section to system message
- Strengthen N calibration (stuttering = HIGH N, not low)
- Add 2 more targeted few-shot examples (high-N, high-E)
- Total: 8 examples (3 caregiving + 5 restaurant/PERSONAGE)
